# git-project
This is a Terminal based github manager which will make it easy to use github command.
You just have to follow some really simple steps and let the program do all the taskes.

I am going to mention some features bellow :
  It is in alfa mode right now so not all the mentioned features are available right now.

    1.Upload source to github first time.

    2.Upload source secod time.

    3.Clone old repo.

    4.Add File into your local repo.

    5.Remove File from your local repo.


I can add more features, as per need.
So if you find any issue or any bug please report me in : rohitdutta907@gmail.com

How to use it :
  Steps :
     
    1. Place the Script into your project folder
    
    2. Open your terminal and Navigate to your project folder
    
    3. Run this command : bash github-terminal.sh
